[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/0d92aa2fdf1d4921a0f74c8c0cf989f7)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/antimatter-dimensions/notations?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=antimatter-dimensions/notations&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

All the notations that are included in the current version of Antimatter Dimensions, and the upcoming Reality Update.

See them in action [here](https://antimatter-dimensions.github.io/notations/).

## Setup

#### CDN

The simplest way to use this package is to include these scripts in your HTML page:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/break_infinity.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@antimatter-dimensions/notations"></script>
```

You can also grab specific versions here:

- https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js/releases
- https://github.com/antimatter-dimensions/notations/releases

#### npm

```
npm install @antimatter-dimensions/notations
```

There is no default export. The correct way to import notations is:

```js
import * as ADNotations from "@antimatter-dimensions/notations";
```

## Use

All the notations are included inside `ADNotations` object:

```js
const scientific = new ADNotations.ScientificNotation();
```

The main method that notations provide is `format(value, places, placesUnder1000)`

- `value` can be `Decimal`, `number` or `string` which you want to format
- `places` is used to format mantissa when number is greater than 1000
- `placesUnder1000` is used to format the number when it is lesser than 1000

```js
const scientific = new ADNotations.ScientificNotation();

// Outputs "1000.00"
console.log(scientific.format(1000, 2, 2));
// Outputs "1.00e100"
console.log(scientific.format("1e100", 2, 0));
// Outputs "1e100"
console.log(scientific.format(new Decimal(1e100), 0, 0));
```

You can configure some formatting aspects via `ADNotations.Settings` object:

```js
const scientific = new ADNotations.ScientificNotation();

// Outputs "1e100,000"
console.log(scientific.format("1e100000", 2, 2));

// Outputs "1e100000"
ADNotations.Settings.exponentCommas.show = false;
console.log(scientific.format("1e100000", 2, 2));

// Outputs "Infinite"
ADNotations.Settings.isInfinite = decimal => decimal.gte(1e100);
console.log(scientific.format(1e101, 2, 2));
```

Configuration settings:

- `Settings.isInfinite` - function that determines if a `Decimal` value is infinite
(default is `decimal => decimal.gte(Decimal.MAX_VALUE)`)
- `Settings.exponentCommas.show` - show commas in formatted output
(default is **true**)  
- `Settings.exponentCommas.min` - lower bound for exponent to be formatted with
commas (default is **100000**)
- `Settings.exponentCommas.max` - upper bound for exponent to be formatted with
commas (default is **1000000000**)

## Extend

Creating your own notations is very simple! Just extend base class `Notation`
and implement the required methods `get name()` and `formatDecimal`:

```js
class SimpleNotation extends ADNotations.Notation {
  get name() {
    return "Simple";
  }

  formatDecimal(value, places) {
    return `Mantissa: ${value.mantissa.toFixed(places)}, Exponent: ${value.exponent}`;
  }
}
```

You can also extend existing notations (like `CancerNotation` does) and override
other methods, but this is a more advanced case which you can figure out by
looking at the source code of existing notations.

## Community Notations

To use community notations, download community pack from the
[dist](https://github.com/antimatter-dimensions/notations/tree/master/dist) directory.
The community pack can be used **separately** from the base pack. To access
community notations from your code, use `ADCommunityNotations` instead of
`ADNotations`. Apart from that, the usage pattern is the same as with
the base pack

If you want your notation to be publicly available via this library, you should
start by adding your notation to a `src/community` folder and making a pull
request with it.

After your PR is merged (which means that one of the maintainers decided that
it is good enough), you can reach out to AD devs about adding it to a base game.
There is no guarantee that it will be added, but all well-made notations will
be available as a community pack.

## Build

First, clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/antimatter-dimensions/notations.git
cd notations
```

Then install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

And then run build command which will build all packs to the dist directory and
to the `docs` directory.

```
npm run build
```

To build base pack or community pack separately, use `build:base` or `build:community`
command.

## Contributing

1. Be reasonable when commiting something.
2. Be original when making a new notation.
